# Optimal
In this project, we derived the nonlinear dynamic equations for a Quadcopter system, linearized the nonlinear model, calculated the cost function, applied various optimal control algorithms, including Dynamic Programming, LQR, SDRE, and Steepest Descent, and finally simulated the control algorithms through MATLAB coding.
